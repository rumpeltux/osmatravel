# =============== Manual Listings Placement ===============================
#
# If you are using manual placement you will need to configure these values
# The best way to come up with these settings is to draw them in inkscape
# and look at the values this produces.  All values are in pixels.  
#
# Do note that the origin of these maps is in the lower left corner.  Y
# values are lower when the pixels are lower on the screen, and vice-versa,
# just as latitude numbers are lower closer to the equater.  Note that this
# makes it much easier to place boxes along the bottom edge.  Just give
# them a Y value of 4.
#
# The logo will be rendered as centered near the bottom of the 4th box.
#
# If you don't need a particular box just set it's height (BOXn_H) to 0
